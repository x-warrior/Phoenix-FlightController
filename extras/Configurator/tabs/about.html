        Phoenix Configurator v <span style="color: red;">0.1</span> <strong>(currently in alpha stage)</strong> was designed to improve user experience by not requiring extensive programming knowledge
        needed to do proper sensor calibration and debugging of various flight controll elements (kinematics, motor outputs, etc).<br />
        This also allows users to do <strong>PID</strong> tuning right from the configurator (<strong>without</strong> needing to reflash the flight controller afterwards).<br />
        <br />
        All changes take effect <strong>immediately</strong>.<br />
