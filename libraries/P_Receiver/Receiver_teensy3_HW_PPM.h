/*  PPM (pulse position modulation) sampling done in hardware via FLEX timer.

    We are using flex timer1 which supports only 2 channels.
    This code only utilizes single edge capture which is more then enough in terms of accuracy.

    Code below supports frame buffering, which is used to protect the controller from
    errors introduced (from simple noise to complete RX failure), if any of the channels in a single
    PPM frame triggered the sanity check, whole frame will be droped and PPM signal values will remain
    unchanged until a valid frame can be sampled.

    PPM_error variable will be increased every time a corrupted frame was detected.

    RX_signalReceived flag is set to 0 every time a valid frame is processed, this variables is used to
    "tell" software there was an error in communication (anything from a corrupted frame to a complete 
    receiver failure), this flag is increased by 1 every 10ms, if it reaches 100 (represnting 1 second)
    an subroutine is triggered that should handle this failure condition, from the most simple routines
    that will just disarm the craft (making it fall from the sky like a boiled potato) to more adnvaced 
    auto-descent routines.

    Please remember that this failsafe is here to prevent craft from "flying away on its own" and
    potentionaly harming someone in the proces (damaged craft from a crash is still better then cutting
    someones head off with uncontrollable craft).

    Big thanks to kha from #aeroquad and Ragnorok from #arduino for helping me get this up and running.
